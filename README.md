So lets first dive into that what actually are Generative Adverserial Neural Networks?
# What are Generative Adversarial Networks?
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) were introduced in 2014 by Ian J. Goodfellow and co-authors. GANs perform unsupervised learning tasks in machine learning. It consists of 2 models that automatically discover and learn the patterns in input data. 

The two models are known as Generator and Discriminator competing with each other to scrutinize, capture, and replicate the variations within a dataset. GANs can be used to generate new examples that plausibly could have been drawn from the original dataset.

In this project we were focussed to convert the satellite images into maps and trained the model to discriminate to create the images as same as possible for the Aerial images.
